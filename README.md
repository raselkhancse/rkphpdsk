#Introduction

PHP Desktop is an open source project founded 
by Rasel Khan in 2017 to provide a way for developing 
native desktop GUI applications using web
 technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and SQLite. 
The development workflow you are used to while creating
 web applications remains the same. There is no new
 `API/framework` to learn. The process of turning an 
existing website into a desktop application is basically 
a matter of copying it to the `rkphpdsk/rkcode/` directory.


In a certain sense phpdesktop acts as a PHP to EXE compiler. It embeds a web browser, a multithreaded web server and a PHP interpreter. All embedded into a single application. The web server embedded is Mongoose (the MIT-licensed version). Supported browsers are Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. The package with Chrome embedded has no external dependencies, everything is included in the phpdesktop binaries and works out of the box on a user's computer.
