#Introduction

PHP Desktop is an open source project founded 
by Rasel Khan in 2017 to provide a way for developing 
native desktop GUI applications using web
 technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and SQLite. 
The development workflow you are used to while creating
 web applications remains the same. There is no new
 API/framework to learn. The process of turning an 
existing website into a desktop application is basically 
a matter of copying it to the "rkphpdsk/rkcode/" directory.
